<h1>THE BASKETBALL COURT</h1>
<p>SO GUYS THE SHORT LINE IN THE 2 ENDS ARE CALLED THE END LINES.THE LINE BETWEEN THE COURT IS CALLED THE HALF LINE. THE LINE BETWEEN THE CIRCLE ARE CALLED THREE FOURTH LINES. AND THERE IS A LINE IN CURVE CALLED THE THREE POINTER LINE.IF YOU WANT TO SCORE 2 POINTS YOU NEED TO BE INSIDE THE 3 POINTER LINE.AND IF YOU WANT TO SCORE A THREE POINTER YOU HAVE TO BE ON THE LINE OR BEHIND THE LINE.</p>
